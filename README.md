## Hello your computer has virus

Hi! I am a C/C++ programmer in Turkey. I really love low level stuff like microcontrollers and OS development.
I am still learning but i can still do some cool stuff with it, I'm hoping.

I support FSF and open source from my heart and all of my projects that i care about will be under GPL v3 while stuff that i don't care will be under MIT licanse.

I am hoping to write operating system soon. Only reason i haven't started is becasue i can't decide it's name.:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 
Also making a bootloader that supports
* Multiboot
* Multiboot2
* Stivale
* Stivale2
* Bootboot

these boot protocols is my dream, but i just don't know how tf i can start making something like that.:grimacing:
I am hoping it would be something that people actually use to boot into their systems.

Right now i am not active on github, it's because... well, i don't have anything cool to show off.
But believe me, i will have something to show off in a few months.

If you wanna collaborate with me on anything you can contact me on discord by this username tas_dogu#7057. Or come to my house. For address contact me by discord. :wink:

My opinions about programming languages that no one should take seriously:
* C: **AMAZING**
* C++: Good, but i find it a bit complex
* Python: Great for small projects and beginners
* C#: Better java
* Java: Bad
* PHP: Interesting  design choices
* Html: Just let a website do it for you
* JS: Should've had it's own port

With this much info if you can't track me down to kill, i am officially dissapointed in you.
